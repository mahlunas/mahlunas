### About me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marcelle Luna, and Iâ€™m a Software Developer at Exiti SoluÃ§Ãµes Digitais.
Iâ€™m currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at UFMS (Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul), where Iâ€™ve been expanding my knowledge of software development, databases, and system design.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, cooking, and playing games â€” hobbies that help me relax and spark creativity after a day of coding.

### Technologies I Work With ðŸ’»
In my daily work, I use a mix of technologies to build efficient and user-friendly applications, including:

Backend: Java (Spring Boot)
Frontend: PrimeFaces, React, TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL, DBeaver
Tools & DevOps: Docker, Git, VS Code, Postman
Others: REST APIs and Axios

Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies, improving my code every day, and building solutions that make a real impact. ðŸš€
